# On-Access Scanning

## Purpose

This guide is for users interested in leveraging and understanding ClamAV's On-Access Scanning feature. It will walk through how to set up and use the On-Access Scanner and step through some common issues and their solutions.

## Requirements

On-Access is only available on Linux systems. On Linux, On-Access requires a `kernel version >= 3.8`. This is because it leverages a kernel api called [fanotify](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fanotify.7.html) to perform its blocking.
